# Style Transfer Network
This repo contains a `Jupyter Notebook` designed to follow a **Neural Style Transfer Algorithm**, whose purpose is to combine an image and a painting style in order to generate a new one with the original composition and a new style.

This Algorithm was first proposed by Leon A. Getys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge in their paper called [**A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf).

This notebook was coded using Python 3.6, Tensorflow 2.2, and Google Colaboratory. The original code was provided as a Tensorflow tutorial and can be found [**here**](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer) 

Here is an example of what this is supposed to do. This example can be found in the original NST Algorithm paper.
